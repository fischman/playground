==========

Playground space for web-related stuff.

[video-to-canvas2d-blur](http://fischman.github.io/playground/video-to-canvas2d-blur.html):
illustrates a cheesy pixelization effect by down-sampling a &lt;video&gt; to a
&lt;canvas&gt;'s 2d context and then stretching the result back out.

test-25fps.mp4 is snagged from [WebKit](http://webk.it/52697).
